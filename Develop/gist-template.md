## Summary

Regex, short for regular expression, is a string that lets you create patterns to help locate, manage, and match text. 

An example is this email matching regex.
```
(/[w._%+-]+@[\w.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}/)
```

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are characters within the regular expression that allow the user to match strings that begin with or ends with (or both) certain characters. 

Examples of Anchors are as follows:

* `^` - matches any string that start with the anterior word
* `$` - matches a string that end with preceeding word before the character
* Examples:

```
^Hello          matches any string starting with `Hello`
World$          matches any string ending with `World`
^Hello World$   matches exact string
goodbye         matches any string that has the exact text `goodbye` in it
```

### Quantifiers

Qunatifiers are characters within the regular expression that specify how many instances a character, group, or character class must be represented in the input to be matched.

Examples of Quanitifers are as follows:

* `*` - matches a string that has the anterior followed by zero or more of the last character
* `+` - matches a string that has the anterior followed by one or more of the last character
* `?` - matches a string that has the atnerior follwoed by zero or one of the last character
* `{}` -  matches a string that has the anterior followed by how ever many the number in the brackets of the last character in the string
* `()*` - matches a string that has any anterior characters followed by zero or more copies of the string within the brackets
* Examples:
```
xyz*        matches a string that has xy followed by zero or more z
xyz+        matches a string that has xy followed by one or more z
xyz?        matches a string that has xy followed by zero or one z
xyz{2}      matches a string that has xy followed by 2 z
xyz{2,}     matches a string that has xy followed by 2 or more z
xyz{2,5}    matches a string that has xy followed by 2 up to 5 z
x(yz)*      matches a string that has x followed by zero or more copies of the sequence yz
x(yz){2,5}  matches a string that has x followed by 2 up to 5 copies of the sequence yz
```

### OR Operator

### Character Classes

Character Classes (Character Set) tells the regex engine to match only one out serveral specific characters, such as digits, words, or whitespace.

Examples of Character Classes are as follows:

```
\d    matches a single any digit 0-9
\w    matches a single any character that is a-z
\s    matches ` `
.     matches any character
\D    matches a single non-digit character
\W    matches a single any non-character that is a-z
\S    matches a single non-` `
```

### Flags

Flags are optional parameters that we can add to a plain expression to make it search in a different way. Each flag is denoted by a single alphabetic character, and serves different purposes in modifying the expression's searching behavior.

Examples of Flags are as follows:
```
/Hello/g   matches all `Hello` in the test
/Hello/m   matches the beginning and ending of each line with `Hello`, rather than the whole string `Hello` itself
/Hello/i   matches all `hello` despite case (Hello, hEllo, heLlo, hellO, hello, HELLO all match)
```

### Grouping and Capturing

### Bracket Expressions



### Greedy and Lazy Match

### Boundaries

Not to be confused with actual characters, simply put, Boundaries are the places between characters. A Boundary should be thought of as a wall between any adjacent characters.
There are two types of Boundaries, **Word** and ***Non-Word**, each denoted by a specific character. 

Examples of Boundaries are as follows:
```
`Hello World` has 12 total Boundaries with 8 Word Boundaries as seen below:
|H|e|l|l|o| |W|o|r|l|d|
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
N W W W W N N W W W W N  -  N = Nonword Boundary \ W = Word Boundary
\bxyz\b     matches a "whole words only search" for the string `xyz`
\Bxyz\B     matches only if the pattern is fully surrounded by word characters `txyzt` would match the string `xyz` because it only has word boundaries
```

### Back-references

When using Grouping (look above) you may Capture the Group, which is saved in memory for later use. Backreferencing is the name given to the action of using these matches. 
Backreferencing is the refernce of a captured match, save in memory, by a captured group.

Examples are a follows:
```
([xyz])\1              using \1 it matches the same text that was matched by the first capturing group
([uwx])([yz])\2\1      we can use \2 (\3, \4, etc.) to identify the same text that was matched by the second (third, fourth, etc.) capturing group
(?<bar>[xzy])\k<bar>   we put the name bar to the group and we reference it later (\k<foo>). The result is the same of the first regex
```

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Look-ahead and Look-behind (lookaround) are `start and end` zero-length assertions [Anchors](#anchors) but they actually match characters, then ends the match, returning only the result: **Match or No Match**. They do not cosume characters in the string, but only assert wether a match is possible or not. Lookaround allows you to create regular expressions that are impossible to create without them, or that would get very longwinded without them.

Examples of Look-ahead and Look-behind are as follows:
```
h(?=t)       matches a h only if is followed by t, but t will not be part of the match
(?<=t)h      matches a h only if is preceded by an t, but t will not be part of the match
```
